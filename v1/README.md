# Projector.nvim : Project Manager for Neovim

## UNSTABLE - Currently in development - Use at you own risk!

Projector.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that adds support for project management.

The main inspiration of this project comes from the excellent [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile "Projectile plugin") for emacs.

## Features

#### Project selection

- Select and load a project session from a configured list (require FZF)
- Add a specific project to a internal list
- Automatically detect project root when adding a new project

#### Session management

- Automatically save and load project session on quit and when switching projects

## Requirements

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim "fzf plugin") for the fuzzy project selection menu

## Configuration

## Usage

## TODOs

- Better session management
